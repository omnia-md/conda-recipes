    # We don't have enough time on travis to build all of the packages.
    # But so far, most of the issues have been related to dependency resolution
    # between the projects, not bugs with the projects themselves (those are
    # handled upstream). So for testing here, we mock out the packages' build.sh
    # to simply be a no-op, which makes things runs faster.
    # this isn't a perfect solution, but it's something.
